* RNAseq folder contains all the RNAseq analysis. 
* Sequencing files were processed with [bcbio](https://bcbio-nextgen.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) using genome GRCh38_90. 
Output was summarized using [bcbioLite](https://github.com/vbarrera/bcbioLite) and stored in RNAseq/data as a [summarizedExperiment](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/SummarizedExperiment.html).
* RNAseq/QC: Quality control reports.
* RNAseq/DE: Differential Expression analysis reports.
