# Methods

RNA-seq counts were generated by [bcbio-nextgen][] using [salmon][] [@salmon]. Counts were imported into [R][] using [tximport][] [@tximport] and [DESeq2] [@LoveHuberAnders2014]. Gene annotations for pseudo-alignment were obtained from [Ensembl][], version Homo_sapiens.GRCh38.98. [AnnotationHub][] was used to obtain annotations for the Rscripts. Data manipulation and plots were done using [Tidyverse][] [@Wickam:2019]. Heatmaps were generated by [pheatmap][] [@pheatmap]. [DEGreport][] was used for the covariate analysis.

Other packages used to generate the report:

- [DT][]
- [reshape][] [@Wickam:2007]
- [rio][]


```{r sessionInfo}
devtools::session_info()
```
